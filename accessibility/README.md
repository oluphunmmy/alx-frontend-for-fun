By the W3C definition, accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and contribute to the Web.

One good example for accessibility is if you can use your website without looking at it. How would all the features and details you spent hours on developing work if you couldn’t use your eyesight to consume the content or use the mouse to interact with it? Imagine instead that you would need to listen to a screen reader that describes the UI and that navigation may not be through the traditional mouse or keyboard input.

Why Accessibility is Often Neglected
While there are many reasons why accessibility is not omnipresent, although ideally it should be, there are three reasons that stick out.

First, it’s hard to accommodate for something that you don’t understand well. Most of the time, it is not motivation that we lack, but rather education on how disabilities prevent people from interacting with our website. This includes lack of knowledge around what disability types exist and how to accommodate them. We just do not know the ins and outs of the problem.

Second, making your application accessible requires a lot of work. Starting from understanding the premises of the standards you need to follow all the way to designing the needed features and functionalities into your app. Then of course, there’s testing whether your approach has yielded the desired result – and much of the testing can only be done manually. The practices described in this article will make this effort easier, but we are still talking about a serious undertaking.

Third is the economic argument which, rightly or not, dominates modern decision making: in most cases, a minority of your clients (or users) would be affected by a disability, which serves as justification to postpone implementing those accessibility improvements for the next release. It’s far easier for a business to justify focusing effort on something that benefits the majority rather than serving a smaller subset of users with improvements that may feel like the application did not actually move forward.

Why Accessibility is Important
It's worth taking some time to consider the benefits of building accessible websites because it's a difficult and time-consuming, therefore costly, undertaking. However, there are solid reasons to be doing it.

Ethics
People with disabilities deal with a lot of challenges on a daily basis. If they are among your clients or users, enabling them to interact with your web app is plain human decency.

Market
There's data that 1 billion people worldwide, and 20% of all internet users, have some form of disability. This is still a minority, but it comprises of a lot more people than most of us would think.

Legal
As legislation in this domain develops, it becomes more and more likely for your business to be required by law to be accessible. We will come back to this as the next section focuses on this exact topic.

User Experience
Accessibility guidelines are designed to help people access and use your website more easily. As a side effect, most of them improve usability and directly benefit all users, including those without disabilities. For example, readable text helps not only people with poor sight, but all users.

Engineering
Many of the good practices for accessibility are good engineering and design principles in general. Often it is the poorly written code that is not accessible. For those of us who strive for mastery of our craft, accessibility is just a matter of doing a good job.

Reputation
Having a more accessible website than your competition is a competitive advantage. It can also help create goodwill towards your brand.

SEO
There is some overlap between good practices for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and web accessibility. For example, writing semantic HTML with proper use of descriptive attributes such as labels, video transcription, image captioning and using title and header tags all improve both a website’s SEO and its accessibility.
