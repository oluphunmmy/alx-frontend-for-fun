## SASS

Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets (Sass) A scripting language that generates CSS style sheets for Web pages. 
Sass makes it easier to develop CSS files, and the Sass interpreter turns the SassScript language into CSS code.
 Sass originally used indents to separate code, 
while the second-generation SCSS uses braces and semicolons, more like CSS.
